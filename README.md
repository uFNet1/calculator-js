# Calculator written in pure JavaScript

[Try it now!](https://ufnet1.github.io/calculator-js/)

My implementation of a web calculator that looks like a *certain* popular one 🍎  
I plan to add custom skins in the future.

## Features
- **Remember previous results** — they appear at the top of the display.  
- **Erase unnecessary digits** with the *⬅* button.  
- **Basic math operators** — multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.  
- **Clear everything with one button** — **_C_**.  
- **Keyboard support** — use digits and operators on your keyboard;  
  *Enter* to **calculate** the result;  
  *Backspace* to **remove** digits one by one;  
  *Escape* to **clear** everything.

## Structure
- `index.html` — entry point  
- `style.css` — styling  
- `app.js` — app logic
